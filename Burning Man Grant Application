Artwork Title
The Library of Babel

Artist Bio
Warrick, the project lead, graduated from Emory University in spring 2013 with degrees in mathematics, physics, and chemistry.  He interned at Reno is Artown last summer, during which he realized that the lifestyle of an artist allowed one to retain the spontaneity and freedom of a child.  Soon thereafter discovering The Generator, he realized this lifestyle was fully possible, and Warrick began making small art for the 2013 burn.  Working here inspired him to continue this lifestyle, which is why he assembled the team applying for this grant.

The crew thus far consists of eight people, all possessing unique skills and experiences integral to the manifestation of this project.  About half come from Reno, the rest from around the country.  The group consist of both veteran burners and individuals who have yet to attend.  All have stated their intention to bring passion and original thought to the Library.

Philosophical Statement
In his seminal story The Library of Babel, Borges describes a universe consisting of a single, indefinite library containing every book, in which consist “all the possible combinations of the twenty odd orthographic symbols.”  This universe consists of repeating vertical hexagonal rooms, four of whose walls are occupied by the limitless books.  The inhabitants of the library have the privilege to read these books, and through them discover all language, knowledge, pasts and futures.  Using this story as my inspiration, I intend to construct The Library of Babel.  Instead of having books already filled; however, the participants of Burning Man, the wanderers in search of a Caravanserai, will become the librarians who inhabit this space and write these books.  The intent is to interpret and expand on Borges’ ideas, not just reiterate them. Rather than have the librarians be passive observers in a world of omnipotent literature, they are asked to create this world.

        The theme of this project is simple: that we are unlimited in thought and creativity.  Our ability to express ideas begins with words, but diverges into many realms of nonverbal language.  The Library asks participants where this distinction lies.   Upon entering the space, one will feel compelled to address this enigmatic question.  Whether reading what others have written, composing one’s own stories, sketching an idea, or simply admiring the mood and discussing its values with a friend or stranger, this library will inspire one to explore the range and limits of language.

        The library will be a distinct resting place for the pilgrims of the playa: a stop for the confused and inspired travelers in the expanse of the desert to sit, read, write, discuss, and imagine.  It will be a point of convergence for all language, culture, and peoples traveling to the caravanserai of the playa.  Indeed, the library will act as a caravanserai on the playa itself.   Rather than an area to mourn and remember those passed, the library setting will encourage the exploration of future ideas and the creative potential we all seek to unleash.

Physical Description


        The ideas unleashed by The Library of Babel will be a product of the unique design and motifs evident in its fabrication.  Its architectural inspiration draws from the monolithic mosques ubiquitous throughout ancient Islam.  Its most specific style reference is to the Dome of the Rock, the oldest Islamic structure known to still exist today.   Its hexagonal shape is a product of Borges’ description in the story and the symmetry within the Islamic structures.  The exterior will be painted using the same geometries used to generate the ancient girih tile patterns which adorned ancient Islamic structures, reusing this once lost artistic method  for the first time in hundreds of years [see Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture] .  In taking this form, our Library will serve as both a historically relevant structure, and a product of fiction and imagination inspired by Borges.  These two seemingly distant ideas in reality display the unity of those two concepts within the mind of the traveler:  the objective,profound past complemented by the untold yet imaginable future.  The external  roof of library will have an elegant cupola, a geodesic hemisphere constructed from conduit and covered in custom sewn fabric likewise paying testament to the girih patterns.  It will be surrounded by six smaller hemispheres.

        The interior will likewise instill within the wanderer unique sensations of magnanimity.  Four of the six walls will contain the bookshelves, each being of a unique form representing linear, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic geometry, presenting the ambiguity of both our known universe and that of Borges’ proposed chapel.  The bookshelves should each contain about a hundred books, with each book being handmade from recycled paper and bound in cardboard and fabric.  The bookshelves will be elevated on steps, drawing a comparison to the Islamic Minbar, a “symbol of authority” and divinity from which sermons are read to the people.  The interior walls will be decorated with layers of wood through which designs are cut and engraved using  laser and CNC, with LED lighting effects in the space between the cutouts.

        The building will be one story, with the floor containing 4 tables.  Each table will have corresponding parametrically designed chairs. The center of the room will have a railing area approximately 6 feet in diameter inside of which will be a mirror pointed to the ceiling.  The ceiling will have a parallel mirror.  These opposite mirrors will be arranged in such a way that they reflect each other, thereby creating the illusion of the library consisting of an indefinite number of stories extending as far as the eye can see.

        The Library will contain windows on each wall, but will likewise be illuminated via artificial lights during both day and night which will be powered by two external generators.

Burning Man partially funds art projects. Where else do you plan to gather the necessary funds for completing the installation?
This project is intended to incorporate as many participants as possible;  a fundamental means being through funding.  The three primary sources of funding will be a Kickstarter fundraiser, two to three large events, and private donations and art grants.  Our Kickstarter will include everything from small scale schwag up to the custom furniture we will produce for the project.  We will not, however, use “premium gifts” as a means of fundraising (some kind of paid experience on playa), and will only include material gifts relevant to the theme of the project.

        The events will be organized and thrown in and around Reno this summer.  We have begun plans for coordinating at least one event with Reno is ARTown, a local organization which targets increasing art in the local community.  The other main event will be a party organized with and thrown with the up and coming Green Sol theme camp, likewise encouraging community and awareness without targeting just the immediate burning man circle.

        The will likewise target grant money from other organizations.  We will apply for a $1000 Nevada Arts Council Jackpot Grant, $1000 through the Dean and Gloria Smith Foundation, and $2000 dollars from the Rocklin Foundation in Reno.

        All those assisting in fundraising who do go to burning man will be asked to participate by visiting the art project and hopefully writing or sketching in one of the books.



Urban Planning for Art
yes

Please describe any changes or modifications you would want to make to the piece to make its placement possible.
While a primary motivation for this piece is Burning Man 2014, our intention is to further use certain pieces in both future burns and a public space.  As we don’t expect the participants to fill the approximately 80,000 blank pages in a single week (although it would be a pleasant surprise if they did!) we hope to keep the books on display at either a public library or the University of Nevada Library for the majority of the year.  The books would then return periodically to Burning Man every year, incorporated in various other installations, to allow the stories to continue.  Once completed, the books would be installed in libraries in the Reno community, or go elsewhere on display around the country to allow the Library of Babel to reach as many minds as possible.

        We also intend all of the plywood with the girih patterns painted on it to go display at local schools, along with accompanying descriptions and possibly lectures about how they beautifully connect history, art, and mathematics.

        The rest of the materials will either be donated to The Generator, or reused in future Burning Man art projects.

How will you illuminate your artwork?
We plan to use the flood lights and Par Cans to illuminate the outer structure, and therefore they will be the first pieces our crew sets up and the last piece taken down.  LED washlights will be installed in and around the structure to further illuminate the piece.  The inside will likewise be lit by the LED bulbs and ropes.

Safety
As our project is NOT intended to be climbed on, our safety concerns are primarily within making the structure as sturdy as possible for the primary adversary: wind.  A local Reno architect, Greg Erny, has been consulted regarding the preliminary design and will continue to assist as the project progresses to ensure that this safety obligation is met.  The library will be lit to full visibility during the build and deconstruction so as to ensure it does not endanger anyone else on playa.

Interactivity
The fundamental premise behind our library is interactivity through people writing and drawing in the books.  The aesthetic of the library is meant to both lure and keep people in the structure, while the acts of writing and discussion will be its primary and secondary means of interaction.  We don’t expect most people to spend only a few minutes in the library before moving on.  We anticipate it to fully fill the role of a caravanserai, that being a place of rest and rejuvenation in an area isolated from the amenities people naturally seek.  The participants are hoped to share an intimate, original story in the books, while likewise reading and experiencing others around them.  This level of engagement cannot arise from an ephemeral stay, and is expected to result from hours of intimate interaction with the piece.

Dimensions
Feet Height: 48
Feet Length: 48
Feet Width: 48



Materials
The library will be fabricated primarily of wood, although the geodesic domes will be made of conduit as their light weight will greatly facilitate and expedite the build.  The wood will be bought recycled as much as it is available and as long as it does not interfere with the structural integrity.  The books themselves will made of recycled paper donated in kind.

As our build will correlate to the budget at a given stage of the build, we will make a large effort to get as many materials donated as possible.  These materials will be used to build the prefabricated wall pieces, and it will come in stages.  This building method acts as a buffer under the condition that fundraising does not meet the budget constraints, as the walls may be constructed from two prefabricated pieces instead of three, certain lights may be eliminated, certain material downgrades on the cupola fabric can take place, and cheaper plywood may be used to construct the parametric furniture.  Our crew fully anticipates meeting all our funding requirements, but the project will persist if those constraints are not met.

Transportation to Playa
One if we go from four - midnight.

Leave No Trace plan


As all our materials for building will be prefabricated in Reno, we do not plan to more than slight modifications on playa.  A tarp will be brought so that if cuts need be made on playa, it will be easily contained.  Moop checks for the teams will be mandated at beginning, middle, and end of a shift.  We don’t intend to have enough waste materials on playa so as to be difficult to coordinate.



Once the project is built, our crew will send people to the project twice daily to check for moop in and around the library.



As we won’t burn the piece, the cleanup will be neat, efficient, and moop free.  The deconstruction of the piece should take no more than two days, and as we wish to preserve the project, care will be taken to keep it intact and without the need to create waste.  Once the materials are gone will will work to restore the playa to the extent that nobody could tell it had ever been inhabited by any foreign objects.
